# Formula Input - Testing Guide for HR

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This is a complete implementation of a **Causal-style formula input** component with all mandatory features. Test each requirement systematically using this guide.

---

## âœ… **Feature 1: Supporting Operands Between Tags**

**Requirement:** `(+,-,*,(,),^,/â€¦..)`

### How to Test:

1. Type `Revenue` and select from autocomplete
2. **Press any operator key**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `(`, `)`, `%`
3. The operator should appear immediately between tags
4. Try building: `Revenue + Cost * Users / 100`

### âœ… **Expected Result:**

- All operators work instantly when typed
- Operators appear as gray badges between blue variable tags
- Formula: `Revenue + Cost * Users / 100`

---

## âœ… **Feature 2: Support Adding Natural Numbers**

**Requirement:** `(1,2,3)`

### How to Test:

1. Type any number: `100`, `3.14`, `999`
2. Press Enter or add an operator
3. Try: `Revenue + 1000 - 250`

### âœ… **Expected Result:**

- Numbers are detected automatically
- Numbers appear as blue tags (same as variables)
- Formula: `Revenue + 1000 - 250`

---

## âœ… **Feature 3: Supporting Writing Between Tags**

**Requirement:** Insert text at any position in the formula

### How to Test:

1. Create formula: `Revenue + Cost`
2. **Click between "Revenue" and "+"** (you'll see a blinking cursor)
3. Type `Users` - it should insert exactly there
4. **Result:** `Revenue Users + Cost`
5. Use **arrow keys** to move cursor left/right
6. Try inserting at different positions

### âœ… **Expected Result:**

- Cursor appears exactly where you click
- Text inserts at cursor position (not at the end)
- Arrow keys move cursor between elements

---

## âœ… **Feature 4: Deleting a TAG with Backspace**

**Requirement:** Remove tags using backspace key

### How to Test:

1. Create formula: `Revenue + Cost + Users`
2. **Position cursor** after any tag (click or use arrows)
3. **Press Backspace** â†’ Should delete the tag before cursor
4. Try deleting from different positions

### âœ… **Expected Result:**

- Backspace deletes the tag immediately before cursor
- Cursor position updates correctly
- No tags are left "orphaned"

---

## âœ… **Feature 5: Autocomplete After Operators**

**Requirement:** `Support autocomplete also after an operand is written`

### How to Test:

1. Type `Revenue`
2. **Press `+`** (operator)
3. **Immediately start typing** `Cost` â†’ Autocomplete should appear
4. Try: `Revenue + C` â†’ Should show "Cost", "CAC", "Conversion Rate"
5. Test with other operators: `*, -, /, (, )`

### âœ… **Expected Result:**

- Autocomplete appears immediately after any operator
- No need to click or refocus input
- Shows relevant suggestions based on what you type

---

## âœ… **Feature 6: MANDATORY - Tag Dropdowns**

**Requirement:** `Adding attached dropdown to each tag on the right`

### How to Test:

1. Add any variable tag (e.g., `Revenue`)
2. **Hover over the tag** â†’ See small arrow on the right
3. **Click the dropdown arrow** â†’ Menu opens with 5 options
4. Test each option:
   - **Edit Variable**: Changes tag name in real-time
   - **Format Number**: Changes tag value in real-time
   - **View Properties**: Shows tag details popup
   - **Duplicate**: Creates exact copy of tag
   - **Delete**: Removes tag completely

### âœ… **Expected Result:**

- Every tag has a working dropdown menu
- All 5 options work as described
- Changes apply immediately to the formula

---

## âœ… **Feature 7: BONUS - Calculating Values**

**Requirement:** `Assign dummy variable values and accept operations`

### How to Test:

1. Create formula: `Revenue - Cost`
2. **Look below the formula** â†’ See green result box
3. Try: `(Revenue + Users) * 2`
4. Check that calculations update in real-time

### âœ… **Expected Result:**

- Green result box shows calculated value
- Uses dummy values for variables (Revenue=50,000, Cost=25,000, etc.)
- Supports order of operations with parentheses

---

## ðŸš€ **Complete Testing Scenario**

### Step-by-Step Complete Test:

1. **Type:** `Revenue` â†’ Select from autocomplete
2. **Type:** `+` â†’ Operator appears
3. **Type:** `Cost` â†’ Select from autocomplete
4. **Type:** `*` â†’ Operator appears
5. **Type:** `2` â†’ Number appears
6. **Click between Revenue and +**
7. **Type:** `Profit` â†’ Should insert there: `Revenue Profit + Cost * 2`
8. **Click dropdown on any tag** â†’ Test Edit, Format, Properties, Duplicate, Delete
9. **Position cursor and press Backspace** â†’ Should delete tags
10. **Check green result box** â†’ Should show calculated result

### âœ… **Final Expected Formula:**

Interactive formula with tags, operators, numbers, working dropdowns, and real-time calculation.
